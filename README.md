Lab 1:Basic Device Security
      In this lab, we have configured encrypted and un-encrypted passwords on both router and switch.

Lab 2: Static Routing
       Here we are configuring the static router from PC --> R1--> R3 --> R4 --> PC2
       command used:
        Router(config)# ip route [destination_network_ ip_address] [destination_subnet_mask]  [exit_router_ip_address]

Lab 3: VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) + Static routing
       Here we are using VLSM to confirgure 4 LANs from ip address 192.168.5.0/24 and then configure the static route on each each router.
